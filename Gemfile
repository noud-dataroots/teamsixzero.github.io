# NOTE: I couldn't get jekyll processor syntax to behave nicely with eslint, so
# I opted to convert by hand (I'm pretty attached to in-editor linters,
# vscode-eslint couldn't handle this one). Solution would be to find vscode or eslint
# solution that ignored jekyll pre-processing dashes required at start of file

# gem 'jekyll-babel'
