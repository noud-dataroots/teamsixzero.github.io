        We focused on creating a centralized space for the most important info. 
        Right now that is the onboarding steps, later on it might be upcoming 
        payments. This design also keeps payment history in sight at all times, 
        so nothing gets missed.

      We simplified the payments flow to make it easier to follow. Instead of taking 2 steps, we get right to it. The design also feels more consistent with the rest of the app.
