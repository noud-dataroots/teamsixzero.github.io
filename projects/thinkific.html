      Thinkific enables entrepreneurs to create, market, sell, and deliver 
      their own online courses. Here are a few ways we helped them in their 
      mission to revolutionize the way people learn and earn online.

        User Groups
      </h4>
      <p>
        It wasn&rsquo;t until we started talking to customers that we recognized 
        how different each use case for Groups was. After extensive user research 
        and iteration we designed User Groups to give every Thinkific school a 
        better way to organize existing students and sell to new ones.

      Main Menu
    </h4>
    <p>
      We redesigned the Thinkific main navigation to be friendlier, more 
      powerful for everyone, and include global search. With such a diverse 
      user base we spent a lot of time understanding what instructors different 
      disliked about the existing navigation, how they navigated the app, and 
      what features they used the most in order to understand how we could 
      improve their experience and productivity.

      <p>
        One of the biggest complaints Thinkific got was about the beauty and flexibility of their website themes &mdash; a huge component of the Thinkific platform. Users wanted their sites to match their brands and unique needs but the existing system just wasn&rsquo;t flexible enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        We helped design a flexible platform that allows developers and 
        designers to create totally unique, beautiful, and fully customizable 
        websites, empowering Thinkific instructors to fully tailor their site to their needs without any design skills.

      <p>
        Thousands of instructors use the Course Builder every day to create and manage their online courses.
      </p>
      <p>
        We heard time and time again from users that they were painters, sailing instructors, or yoga teachers, not web designers. We designed the course builder to be intuitive so instructors of all technical abilities could create an online course without having to hire a team of developers.

      Purchase Flow
    </h4>
    <p>
      Accepting money from eagar course creators should have been easy, but we heard from many Thinkific users that the payment experience wasn't easy or confidence inspiring. We worked to remove the friction and give users all the information they needed to confidently make a decision and get their online course out into the world no matter what device they were on.
