      Thinkific enables entrepreneurs to create, market, sell, and deliver 
      their own online courses. Here are a few ways we helped them in their 
      mission to revolutionize the way people learn and earn online.

        User Groups

      <p>
        We designed User Groups to give schools a better way to organize existing 
        students and sell to new ones.

      Main Menu
    </h4>
    <p>
      We redesigned the Thinkific main navigation to be friendlier, more 
      powerful for everyone, and include global search. With such a diverse 
      user base we spent a lot of time understanding what people different 
      disliked about the current navigation, how they navigated the app, and 
      what features they used the most in order to understand how we could 
      improve their experience and productivity.

      <p>
        Thousands of people use the builder every day to build and manage their online courses.

        The drag and drop course builder interface allows people of all technical abilities to create their own online course without having to hire a team of developers.

      We like to built software that gets out of your way. We don&rsquo;t want
