        Shopping for a new pair shoes online can be daunting. Finding cool new 
        brands and styles is a challenge, and sizing is always huge risk. While 
        companies do plenty of things to help reduce anxiety and inspire 
        confidence while purchasing, there is always a little voice saying 
        &ldquo;I really hope these fit!&rdquo;.
      </h6>
      <h6 class="intro__copy">
        FTSY approached us to help them improve the shoe shopping experience 
        so that everyone can experience their Cinderella moment and find the 
        perfect pair of shoes without the stress.

      Before we begin
    </h4>
    <p>
      Our first priority was to gain a deep understanding of how potential FTSY 
      users went about shopping for shoes online. We wanted to learn what 
      worries them, what they like or dislike, and what makes a good shopping 
      experience. We also needed to know how well the existing FTSY app 
      performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do this, we did 5 individual user testing sessions. During the 
      interviews, we dug deep and figured out what each person&rsquo;s vision of a 
      great shopping experience looked liked and got each person to try the 
      FTSY app. The thoughts and insights they shared were invaluable.
    </p>
    <p class="has-no-padding-bottom ">
      We used the findings from these sessions as the foundation for our redesign.

      <p>
        Our testing sessions told us to focus on features that would help 
        shoppers make a purchase more confidently. That meant concentrating on 
        the product pages. We made the images larger so you could see every last 
        detail, we showed the available colours and price more prominently, 
        we made the product descriptions easier to find, and showed the sizing 
        front and center.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also changed the purchase button. Test participants described being 
        surprised or hesitant to press the button in the original app because 
        they were unsure of the next step. A color and copy change removed 
        those worries.

        <p>
          5 out of 5 test participants told us over and over that they just wanted 
          to get to the good part &mdash; the shoes! 
        </p>
        <p>
          This meant redefining the structure of the app, and removing the 
          cumbersome onboarding flow that caused so much confusion. We wanted 
          people to freely browse all the unique shoes as quickly as possible so 
          they could fall in love before they needed to scan their feet and 
          enter any account details.

      <h4 class="project__name">The magic ingredient</h4>
      <p>
        FTSY&rsquo;s scanning technology is the magic ingredient in the FTSY 
        sauce. The scanner builds a super accurate 3D model by taking 24 photos 
        of a shoppers feet guaranteeing any shoes you buy through FTSY fit 
        perfectly. 
      </p>
      <p>
        While our participants loved the idea, they found it slow and 
        difficult to get a successful scan.
      </p>
      <p>
        We designed a scanning experience that is much faster and easier to use 
        by focusing on giving shoppers clear instructions, a better sense of 
        progress, and a clearer UI.
