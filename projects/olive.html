      Olive connects technology buyers with the right solutions and technology 
      vendors with their target customers. In other words, Olive is out to 
      kill steak dinner handshake deals and biased RFPs.
      We helped Olive bring both sides together into one easy to use app.

    <p>
      Olive believe in a transparent unbiased sales process that helps 
      companies avoid the costly mistake of getting sold the wrong solution.
    </p> 
    <p>
      They help technology buyers make more accurate, unbiased decisions 
      with significantly lower costs and effort by looking deeply at their 
      needs and suggesting best fit technology solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the flip side, Olive also helps technology vendors significantly 
      reduce their customer acquisition costs by offering insights and access 
      to the needs of target customers directly from the source.
    </p>
    <p>
      We helped Olive bring everything together into one easy to use app 
      that we designed from the ground up.

      The Buyer Mindset
    </h4>
    <p>
      We talked to lots of people who buy software for a living during our 
      lean UX discovery phase, and we learned that being able to collect, 
      organize, and rate requirements in a single location was a critical 
      part of making great purchasing decisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this in mind we designed a way for stakeholders to easily input, 
      rate, and organize their needs all in one place. Requirements can be 
      broken down by team, individual, category, and rating to really 
      understand what&rsquo;s needed.

        Simple Evaluations
      </h4>
      <p>
        Complex decision matrices, tangled spreadsheets, orphaned documents, 
        yawn filled whiteboard sessions. These are the tools teams told us 
        they were using to make their purchasing decisions. Olive knew there 
        was a better way.
      </p>
      <p>
        We created a drag and drop evaluation grid that gives buyers the 
        ability to see how well vendors meet their needs and cross examine 
        each of the top suggestions. The evaluation grid offers stakeholders 
        a snapshot of exactly how and why a vendor fits their needs and gives 
        them a single source of truth to share with the decision makers.

      <h4 class="project__name">Leads That Matter</h4>
      <p>
        Selling software these days means piecing together information about 
        prospects through lots of creative Googling, LinkedIn sneaking, company 
        about sections, and a little black magic. We heard there is still a 
        lot of “gut feeling” going into qualifying leads. On top of that, 
        vendors told us that valuable insights about why a buyer decided to 
        purchase gets lost after the ink dries.
      </p>
      <p>
        We designed an interface for vendors to quickly see if a lead is worth 
        pursuing, what the buyers needs are, and what their questions are, 
        allowing vendors to make a decision it instantly.
