    <p>
      Whatever you’ve decided to test, ensure it’s workable so as not to confuse 
      the user in ways that will take them out of the experience. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re testing a very early prototype, that doesn’t mean you need to invest
       hours to make it perfect, but it’s worth running through the prototype a 
       couple times to make sure any rough spots are smoothed out. To be frank, if 
       your prototype is full of bugs or dead ends, it will ruin the test.
    </p>
    <h3 id="set-the-stage-with-a-realistic-scenario">
      Set the stage with a realistic scenario
    </h3>
    <p>
      Giving users a realistic scenario provides the context they need to 
      successfully perform a task. This is when you’ll want to consider introducing 
      specific constraints that will help frame their thinking. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, let’s say you’re doing a test for Airbnb, and you’d like to 
      improve the user experience for guests booking last-minute vacations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practice that looks like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Imagine you’re trying to book a trip under a tight timeline. How might you 
      go about getting a house booked in New York for next weekend?”
    </p>
    <p>
      In the scenario above, the constraints include: booking type (house), 
      location (New York), timeframe (next weekend).
    </p>
    <h3 id="write-your-script">
      Write your script
    </h3>
    <p>
      By this point you’ve already defined what you want to understand and created 
      a realistic scenario. Use these details to guide your script. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if you want to find out “if users are able to create an account 
      successfully,” make sure there’s a question in your script for that. 
      Remember: Each statement should have an accompanying question in the script. 
      If we use the example above, we’d want to make sure there was a question 
      like, “How do you think you would create an account?”
    </p>
    <p>
      As you create the rest of your script, try to imagine what your user will be 
      experiencing and craft your questions accordingly. A good exercise for this 
      is to walk through your prototype like step-by-step. The point here is to 
      anticipate what your participants might find difficult so you can ensure 
      you have questions prepared to tease out why they’re finding it difficult.

    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking about this in advance will give you confidence going into the 
      session, which puts your participants at ease. Not only that, you’ll ask 
      better follow-up questions, keep things on track, and recover more easily 
      if things go way off the rails
    </p>
    
    <h6 class="callout__title">Follow-up questions</h6>
    <p>
      You don’t need to be a journalist to come up with great follow-up 
      questions, you just need to be curious. For example, when a participant 
      says they like or don’t like something, ask them:
      <ul>
        <li>What don’t you/do you like about it?</li>
        <li>How might you improve it?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If a participant is surprised by something, ask them:
      <ul>
        <li>Why were you surprised?</li>
        <li>What did you expect to happen?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      At the start of a new flow or feature, ask participants:
      <ul>
        <li>What do you think this is?</li>
        <li>What are your initial impressions, thoughts, and feelings?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If a participant breezes through something important, stop them and ask:
      <ul>
        <li>Did you notice it? Why not?</li>
        <li>Do you care?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a user has completed a flow, ask them:
      <ul>
        <li>What were your overall impressions?</li>
        <li>Did it match your impression of it before you started?</li>
        <li>Was it valuable?</li>
        <li>What did you like?</li>
        <li>What did you dislike?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    

    <h3 id="dont-forget-the-software-usability-scale">Don’t forget the ‘Software Usability Scale</h3>
    <p>
      Developed in 1986, the Software Usability Scale (SUS) is a reliable tool for 
      measuring the usability of your product.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the SUS is used, participants are asked to score the following 10 items 
      on a scale of one to five, with ‘Strongly Disagree’ (1) on one end and 
      ‘Strongly Agree’ (5) on the other.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>I think that I would like to use this system frequently.</li>
      <li>I found the system unnecessarily complex.</li>
      <li>I thought the system was easy to use.</li>
      <li>I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.</li>
      <li>I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.</li>
      <li>I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.</li>
      <li>I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.</li>
      <li>I found the system very cumbersome to use.</li>
      <li>I felt very confident using the system.</li>
      <li>I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>Including the SUS in every usability test has the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Provides your team with a baseline usability score. When you’ve completed 
        all your user tests, either add all the scores together for an overall 
        score, or find the average.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allows you to compare scores between tests. Did one user score something 
        higher than another user? This may provide additional insights regarding the 
        usability of your product with respect to different personas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gives you leverage when convincing stakeholders where you invest time 
        and resources. It also lets you easily demonstrate to stakeholders how 
        your product has improved as you do more and more tests down the line.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>
      In terms of when to ask these questions, we suggest at the end of every script.
    </p>

    <h3 id="test-the-test">
      Test the test
    </h3>
    <p>
      One of the best pieces of advice we can offer is to do a couple dry runs of 
      the test on anyone you can find, whether a coworker or a friend. Don’t worry 
      about getting someone who matches your perfect user &mdash; dry runs are for making 
      sure your script makes sense and nothing feels awkward or confusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your real participants are participating remotely, a dry run will also 
      give you the opportunity to see if it makes sense without you sitting right 
      next to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, use the dry run to time your test. We find between 1 and 1.5 hours 
      to be the sweet spot for getting value while keeping your participant 
      engaged &mdash; any longer and everyone in the room starts to get tired. Long 
      tests also create a mountain of recordings to parse after the fact, which 
      can be time consuming and repetitive.
    </p>

    <h3 id="modify-as-you-go">Modify as you go</h3>
    <p>
      We’re not doing actual science here, so feel free to change the test as you 
      learn.  Some of the best insights we’ve gotten were the result of subtle 
      tweaks we made as we went. This can mean changes to the test itself, asking 
      a different question, posing a scenario differently, or making changes to 
      the UI to fix obvious issues from early tests that hung people up.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Screen recording software. If you have a preferred screen recording tool, 
          great. If not, try out Quicktime screen recording — it’s our favourite.
        </li> 
        <li>
          Mobile app recording setup. If you’re testing a mobile app, we love using 
          Mr.Tappy. Using a tool like this also allows users to pick up the device, 
          making the test more realistic.
